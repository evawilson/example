# example

This "example" package includes a dataset for 50 random precipitation amounts (`precipitation`) as well as a dataset containing a list of 50 different crops (either barley, wheat, or corn) and their associated evapotranspiration value (`default_crop_ET`). 

This data can be used with the package function, `irrigation()`. More information on this function and the `default_crop_ET` dataset can be found using the help documentation. 

To install this package, download the zip folder "example_0.1.0.zip" locally and install locally with R Studio. After installation and loading the package (`library(example)`), the datasets, function, and associated documentation will all be available.
